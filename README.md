# GY7702 Assignment repository 

## Introduction
This is a repository for the [**GY7702 R for Data Science**](https://le.ac.uk/modules/2020/gy7702) assignment at the University of Leicester. 
The aim of this assignment was to explore various aspects of the R programming language through the use of popular libraries and real-life data. 
Additionally, this was a fantastic exercise in the exploration of Github, README.md files and professional coding practice. 

This assignment is broken down into 4 stages: 

1. Basic vector manipulation with example survey data. 
2. Exploring table operations with the *penguins* table in *palmerpenguins*.
3. Reading data with *readr* and utilizing UK COVID-19 data 
4. Analysis of COVID-19 cases with accompanying UK population data

## Prerequisites
The dependencies for the assignment are:
* tidyverse
* dplyr
* knitr
* palmerpenguins
* readr

## Data 
The data used in this assignment is in [GY7702_data](https://github.com/Elliot-JG/GY7702_assignment/tree/main/GY7702_data). There are two .csv files:
